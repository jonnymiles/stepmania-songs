Stepfile notes:

OK You know the drill, beginner steps contain no multiple arrow
streams, light steps just a generic konami style chart, difficult
introduces 8ths, heavy and challenge however, ive made heavy SOMETHING
like karaoke steps but ive tried to keep them in the style of konami
Challenge is not ITG based but EXACTLY what you would expect if konami
happened to make a legitimate 9 for a uk licenses (As if it would ever happen)

and before you say, NO some girls and nu flow DONT count nor does no limit
because that was made by KONAMI OF JAPAN as a dancemania license rather
than a universal records license :P
