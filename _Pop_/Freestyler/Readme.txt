| The steps were set up to be in the "Dance Dance Revolution" style. One chart    |
| only in both Single and Double play uses Freeze Arrows (Standard chart on both) |
| and no cross over steps are present in Single play. The steps were designed in  |
| the StepMania built-in editor and synchronised to this.                         |
|                                                                                 |

|  | Beginner steps are arrows on every alternating beat as in DDR (some arrows|  |
|  | on adjacent beats only if on the same arrow). In DDR all beginner steps   |  |
|  | under about 180 bpm are 1 foot but because of all the sections with 3     |  |
|  | arrows in a row this has been rated 2 feet anyway.                        |  |

|  | Arrows may be on the adjacent beats with different arrows but are still   |  |
|  | spread out (but also including some long stream and stepjump). It is 4    |  |
|  | feet for these reasons and that of the song BPM.                          |  |

|  | Arrows on most beats. Additional to this, some blue 'off beat' arrows are |  |
|  | introduced, but only as single arrows or streams of 2 or 3 length (with   |  |
|  | the exception of 4 arrow streams in one section). Sections involving      |  |
|  | arrows are an idea originally for the heavy steps that was later replaced |  |
|  | with the current steps employed for the section on heavy steps.           |  |
|  | 6 feet due to off beat arrow usage and streams at this BPM.               |  |

|  | Standard's likeness with 'off beat' arrows but in far longer streams that |  |
|  | move all over the dance pad. In a DDR similarity, follows music closely   |  |
|  | but not too closely. Jumps are placed where they fit.                     |  |

| Doubles steps were re-created from scratch but designed to be similar to singles|
| steps. Same principles outlined above is followed, with exception that double   |
| standard contains longer streams and is rated higher for this reason. Beginner  |
| double is not included since DDR does not do this.                              |

| Video banner created from still banner and video material. It seems to cause    |
| problems at times in Stepmania but apparently that is Stepmania's error.        |
| (Such as when song is completed and returned to song wheel, or when song is     |
| selected by default, or when song is quickly selected and moved back to, or at  |
| any point on Stepmania 4.0). For best result, select other song for 2 seconds   |
| then move back to Freestyler in order to see a banner with correct sync.        |
| (Thank you to recent users of video banners for showing me this idea)           |

| Video edited from official video. Sorry for watermarks, this was my only copy   |
| of the video. Can you spot all Sony product placement?                          |

| Lyrics were originally planned for inclusion but could not be found reliably.   |
| Only many many sites like "lyrics4u" "allfreelyrics" "coollyricsnet" which      |
| disagreed with one another and launched endless advertisements and contained    |
| unvalidated user content... pages and pages of this rubbish on google.          |
| I gave up. The lyrics don't make sense anyway.                                  |
